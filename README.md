# Strategy Backtester

This is an old piece of code I cobbled together to perform the function of creating and backtesting trading strategies in the crypto markets.

## What it does?

Essentially the easiest way to describe this script is by linking to [Backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader). 
The personal aspects of this project are essentially the strategies, p.s. Do not use these strategies, you'll probably lose.

## A Note

The structure of this code truly is terrible, but at the time I had a goal of testing some new strategies and Backtrader was seemingly the best option.
I would very much like to revisit this as a serious project now that I am armed with more skills and knowledge.
